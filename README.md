## Task 1
***
### Write a Python function called `counts` that takes a list as input and returns a dictionary of unique items in the list as keys and the number of times each item appears as values
Following a quick Google search, I found a [discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30208044/how-to-add-list-elements-into-dictionary) on stackoverflow.com which was useful in building the task program. The program utilises two of Python's basic data structures, namely lists and dictionaries. Additionally, it makes use of a `for` loop and `if` statements to complete the task. See .ipynb file above.
